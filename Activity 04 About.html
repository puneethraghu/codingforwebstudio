                    <q> After releasing their 2012 full-length debut Night Visions (featuring the Grammy Award-winning single “Radioactive”),
                        Imagine Dragons spent nearly two years bringing their passionately inventive brand of alt-rock to arenas around the world. <br> <br>

                         To deal with the chaos of a touring schedule that included 130 headline dates and 50 festivals across the globe,
                         the Las Vegas-based quartet threw themselves into creating material for their next album. “So many things were
                         changing for us so quickly, the only way to feel some kind of stability was to keep writing,” says frontman
                         Dan Reynolds, who founded Imagine Dragons with guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. <br> <br>
                         “Going up to my hotel room to work on new songs became something I looked forward to every night on tour,” Reynolds adds.
                         “There were definitely a few times when the person next door’s banging on the wall because it’s 4 a.m. and they’re
                         trying to sleep and I’m in there belting out some song I just wrote.”

                     <q> With Smoke + Mirrors, Imagine Dragons use the frenetic energy of life on the road to infuse their music with both
                        raw tension and intense vulnerability. As on Night Visions—which prompted Imagine Dragons to rack
                        up more than 3.9 million album sales and 24 million track sales worldwide—the band works with sharply
                        crafted beats and grooves to dream up rhythm-driven rock music that’s artful yet visceral. <br>
                        Also revealing the band’s dedication to keeping it homespun, Smoke + Mirrors marks the first <br>
                        release recorded in their new self-built home studio. “Working in a rented studio usually ends up
                        with the creative process being somewhat rushed, so this was the best way to make something at our own pace,”
                        explains Reynolds.</q>
